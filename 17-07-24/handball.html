<p>Handball <u>(also known as team handball, European handball or Olympic handball)</u> is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each (six outcourt players and a goalkeeper) pass a ball using their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the opposing team. A standard match consists of two periods of <b>30 minutes,</b> and the team that scores more goals wins.</p>

<p>
Modern handball is played on a court of <i>40 by 20 metres (131 by 66 ft),</i> with a goal in the middle of each end. The goals are surrounded by a <b>6-metre (20 ft)</b> <i>zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed;</i> goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while "diving" into it. The sport is usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball, Czech handball (which were more common in the past) and beach handball. The game is fast and high-scoring: professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each, though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago. Body contact is permitted for the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal. No protective equipment is mandated, but players may wear <mark>soft protective bands, pads and mouth guards</mark>.</p>

The modern set of rules was published in <strong>1917</strong> by <mark>Karl Schelenz, Max Heiser, and Erich Konigh</mark>, on <b>29 October in Berlin,</b> which is seen as the date of birth of the sport. The rules have had several revisions since. <i>The first official handball match was played in 1917 in Germany.</i> Karl Schelenz modified the rules in 1919. The first international games were played (under these rules) with men in 1925 (between Germany and Belgium) and with women in 1930 (between Germany and Austria)</p>
